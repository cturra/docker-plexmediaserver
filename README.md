(Deprecated) Plex Media Server in Docker
---

I want to thank all the contributors and users of this container! When we began, 5 years ago, there
were limited options for running Plex Media Server in Docker and there was no official support from Plex. 
Over the years, that's changed and there are some really outstanding options out there.

With that said, I have decided to deprecate this project and instead suggest you head on over to use the
official Docker container from Plex Media Server:

 => https://hub.docker.com/r/plexinc/pms-docker/


For more information about the original project, head on into the `archive/` directory of this git repository.
